# Movie Storybook Project

This repository contains the files for my Movie Storybook project, completed as part of a course assignment. A project that involved creating a storybook for a potential movie. The storybook is comprised of a series of images, taken by the team members and converted into drawings using Python. The images are stitched together in Python to create a PDF storybook that includes text.

## Project Overview

- The storybook is produced as a PDF file, consisting of 3-6 pages with approximately 20 images per page, accompanied by text.
- The images are photographs of the team acting out the scenes, which are then transformed into drawings using Python.
- The stitching-together of the images is programmed in Python, without the use of paintbrush-type apps.
- The storybook is produced in two languages: English and Tamil (Regional version).
